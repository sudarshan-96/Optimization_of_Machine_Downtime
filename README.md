## 📈 Project Overview

This project analyzes machine sensor data from a **vehicle fuel pump manufacturing process** to identify key factors contributing to **unplanned machine downtime**.  
By applying **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **statistical techniques**, the project uncovers actionable insights to optimize machine reliability.  
The recommendations derived from the analysis helped reduce downtime by **10%** and achieve **$1M** in cost savings for the client.

## ❓ Project Motivation

Unplanned machine downtime was leading to significant productivity losses and operational inefficiencies for the fuel pump manufacturing process.  
The business was incurring high maintenance costs and losing valuable production hours.  
This project aimed to uncover the **root causes of machine downtime** and develop **data-driven recommendations** to minimize disruptions, reduce costs, and enhance overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).
