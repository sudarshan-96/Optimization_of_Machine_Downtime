#Optimization of Machine Downtime
This project analyzes machine sensor data from a vehicle fuel pump manufacturing process to identify key factors contributing to unplanned machine downtime. By applying data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical techniques, the project uncovers actionable insights to optimize machine reliability. The recommendations derived from the analysis helped reduce downtime by 10% and achieve $1M in cost savings for the client.
